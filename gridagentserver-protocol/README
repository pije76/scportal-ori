This is the GridAgent Server communication protocol.

Communication is message-based.
Messages have a common header with type, length and a field for Boolean where this may simplify the payload.
Apart from the initial handshake, communication is encrypted.
We use a pre-shared key, merged with a nonce from the agent to protect against playback attacks (and with the MAC address from the agent for slightly improved obscurity).
Currently, the set of messages sent by a server is disjoint from the set of messages sent by a client --- though the header is the same, and the type identifiers are global, so this may be changed later.

The protocol has a version number, sent by both sides as part of the handshake.
At present, the server must handle version discrepencies, i.e. communication takes place with the protocol version specified by the client.
