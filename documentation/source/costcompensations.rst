Cost Compensations
==================

Certain uses of energy are considered in the general interest of
society, and are eligible for tax refunds.  Or in general, the tariff
on the same utility may come with a rebate for certain energy uses.
This is where cost compensations come in.

Cost compensations are subtracted from tariff values when calculating
variable costs.

We assume that taxes may only be refunded once for a particular energy
use.  So a cost compensation may apply to all energy uses for a
certain main consumption, with explicit exceptions.  That is, the
energy uses with a specific cost compensation are excluded when
applying a general cost compensation to a main consumption.

Eventually the cost compensations of each energy use of a main
consumption along with the general cost compensation for the same main
consumption will all be applied when calculating the variable costs of
the particular main consumption.

When calculating the variable costs of an energy use, any cost
compensation related directly to the energy use is applied.  If no
such cost compensation exists, we shall fall back to the general cost
compensation of the aggregating main consumption.  Finally if no
general cost compansation is defined for the main consumption no cost
compensation will be applied.
