Projects
========

For energy performances, energy performance indicators, and normalized energy
consumptions it is possible to define a project.  A project has a goal, which
is an percentwise improvement of the involved energy performance, energy
performance indicator or normalized energy consumption.

If the goal is (or can be translated into) a yearly cost reduction and the
investment costs of the project is well-known it is possible to calculated an
expected payback period, which may be used to prioritize which projects to
execute next.

Projects are executed by first measuring a benchmark energy performance or
normalized energy consumption.  Then implement the action of the project.  And
finally measure the resulting energy performance or normalized energy
consumption.

The change in percent between the benchmark and the result gives the achieved
improvement.  If the achieved improvement is better than the goal originally
set out, the goal has been achieved.

After the project has been completed, and costs are well-defined it is possible
to calculate the actual payback period, which may be longer or shorter than
the expected payback period.

That the goal remains acheived can be automatically checked by measuring new
results periodically, and comparing these results to the benchmark and goal.
